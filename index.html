			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				My name is Nicholas Thor Page, and I am currently a Junior at George Mason University, majoring in Computer science. I have lots of programming experience, and I love learning new programming languages or frameworks. I primarily focus on the backend side of things, but I am more than willing to learn how to be a better frontend/fullstack developer. I strive to write code that is both efficient and easy to understand.
